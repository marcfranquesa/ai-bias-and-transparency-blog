Hello everyone! Welcome to our blog, as you very well may guess, we'll be working on **AI Bias & Transparency**. Please remember to complete our [survey](https://forms.gle/sVuNrcnZJubzHN7v9) as we will use the results for our lectures.

Our first lecture will be this Wednesday 10th of April at 11AM. Here are some resources in case you'd like to get started:

- [Introductory article about biases in AI](https://www.ibm.com/blog/shedding-light-on-ai-bias-with-real-world-examples)
- [Introductory article about explainable AI (also called XAI)](https://www.ibm.com/topics/explainable-ai)
