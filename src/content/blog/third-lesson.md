# Third Lesson

In our concluding session we tackled the fundamental question: How to be a good data scientist? We approached this inquiry through a philosophical point of view, drawing upon themes explored in our previous lessons.

At the beginning of the class, we had some students briefly explain what they considered to be the most important aspects of what we covered in the second session, with the intention of sharing these insights with the rest of the group. In the following link you will find the analysis of the activity [link al blog de anàlisi de l’activitat].

Alongside our theoretical explorations, students actively engaged in a quiz designed to evaluate their comprehension and retention of the key concepts we aimed to impart. Curious to test your own knowledge? Follow the link [link a test de coneixements adquirits] provided to take the quiz and assess your grasp of the material covered.

## Postconventional ethics

To properly address ethical challenges in data analysis, it is critical that data scientists adopt universal ethical principles as a guide. This means respecting people's autonomy, promoting justice and being considerate of others. It is not enough to simply follow convention and legality; It is also necessary to have one's own moral sense and seek the opinion of others to make informed and ethical decisions.

## Responsibility

As data scientists, we must reflect on the responsibility that comes with our work. Every action we take, from writing lines of code to training models, can have a significant impact on people's lives. Therefore, it is crucial to consider the ethical and social implications of our decisions and strive to minimize any negative effects that may arise.

## Cognitive bias

After recognizing, questioning the methodology, and taking responsibility, it is crucial to act on the biases present in data analysis. As data scientists, addressing these biases is critical throughout the analysis process. To do this, we must consider what to do, how to do it and what to avoid, as well as identify the problems we face. It is essential to proactively address bias to ensure more accurate, reliable and fair results.

## Transparency and explainability

Despite efforts, it is important to recognize that biases can persist and affect predictions, perpetuating inequalities and disadvantages. Although it is no longer in our hands, we must not stop here. What I cannot do, someone else can surely do, and to facilitate it, we must try to obtain the maximum possible explainability and transparency. Thus, we want to obtain the opposite of a "black box", what has been called a "white box" or "glass box".
