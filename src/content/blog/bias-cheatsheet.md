### Bias in Data

**Representation bias:** Representation Bias happens when the training data under-represents (and subsequently fails to generalize well) some parts of the target population. Data representation bias can originate from how (and from where) the data was originally collected or be caused by the biases introduced after collection, either historically, cognitively, or statistically.

### Prejudice in Design

**Algorithmic bias:** Linked to biased design choices within the algorithms themselves, resulting in discriminatory results.

**Personalization bias:** Personalization or Customization Bias refers to the tendency for humans to prefer options with the ability to customize, even if the final product fits their preferences just as well as an off-the-shelf product would have. Many of the benefits of customization can be explained by preference fit.

### Socio-technical factors

**Audience bias:** Audience bias refers to the tendency for media producers, creators, or communicators to cater their content towards specific audience preferences, demographics, or ideologies.

**Activity bias:** Activity bias is the natural human tendency to favor activity over inactivity, especially in times of stress.

**Cognitive bias:** This is the most common type of bias. Research suggests that there are more than 175 different types of cognitive bias. It refers to deviation from standards of judgement whereby you may create inferences, assessments or perceptions that are unreasonable. You may also recollect past experiences incorrectly. These perceptions may dictate a person’s behaviour or attitude, either in a positive or negative way.

**Copyright bias:** Copyright bias refers to a situation where copyright laws or practices favor certain parties over others, leading to unequal treatment or unfair advantages in the realm of intellectual property rights.

**Commercial bias:** Commercial bias is defined as information presented in a manner that attempts to sway participants' opinions in favor of a particular commercial product for the express purpose of furthering a commercial entity's business.

**Competition bias:** Competition bias refers to a situation where media outlets or content creators prioritize stories, topics, or angles that are driven by the desire to outdo or compete with other outlets rather than focusing on the public interest or journalistic integrity.

**Confirmation bias:** This involves favouring or focusing on information that confirms your existing beliefs and preconceptions. You may automatically discount information that does not confirm your bias.

**Contextual bias:** This refers to when experts who have good intentions are vulnerable to making incorrect decisions, based on external influences or influences that are irrelevant or unrelated to the situation. This can result in a loss of objectivity and can cause the experts to develop subconscious expectations.

**Corporate bias:** Copyright laws may disproportionately benefit large corporations or established entities over individual creators or smaller businesses. This could occur through stronger protections, longer copyright terms, or easier enforcement mechanisms.

**Interaction bias:** Interaction bias captures individuals’ propensity to interact more than by chance with others exhibiting certain traits or behaviours.

**Language bias:** Language bias refers to the idea that we are inclined to favor those who communicate in the same way as us: People who speak our language, have the same accent, and use similar slang.

**Political bias:** Political bias is a bias or perceived bias involving the slanting or altering of information to make a political position or political candidate seem more attractive. With a distinct association with media bias, it commonly refers to how a reporter, news organisation, or TV show covers a political candidate or a policy issue.

**Sensationalism bias:** Sensationalism bias refers to the tendency in media to prioritize or exaggerate stories and events that are emotionally provocative, shocking, or attention-grabbing, often at the expense of accuracy or context.
