## [1. Finance](/posts/case-studies/finance)

The integration of AI and vast data in banking has both advantages and challenges, particularly concerning bias and transparency. AI algorithms in major financial institutions sometimes lead to biased outcomes, disproportionately affecting certain groups like women and minorities. Historical practices, such as redlining, and modern examples, such as FICO score disparities, highlight ongoing biases.

## [2. Recommender systems](/posts/case-studies/recommender-systems)

Recommender systems are software tools that suggest items to users, helping them manage information overload and make decisions. Despite their benefits, these systems introduce biases, such as promoting popular items excessively (popularity bias) and unfairly recommending content based on user attributes, leading to feedback loops and echo chambers that deepen ideological polarization.

## [3. Medicine](/posts/case-studies/medicine)

A healthcare risk prediction algorithm is facing scrutiny for racial bias due to its flawed use of healthcare costs as a metric for determining treatment needs. This bias has led to Black patients being unfairly disadvantaged compared to White patients in accessing high-risk care management programs. The algorithm's developers, hospitals, and insurers all share responsibility for addressing and mitigating these biases. Transparency through disclosing algorithm variables and involving medical professionals in decision-making processes are recommended steps to promote fairness and equity in healthcare access.
