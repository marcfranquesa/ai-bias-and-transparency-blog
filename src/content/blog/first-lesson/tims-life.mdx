In <a href={SITE.base + "/posts/first-session/tims-day"}>Tim's day</a>, we saw small moments in his life where biased algorithms affected him. Here we'll see how these biases have impacted Tim during crucial moments of his life.

Picture Tim at the age of 17/18. He's on the brink of finishing high school, bubbling with excitement about starting university. But first, he must choose which university to attend! He wants to make the most informed decision possible, so he turns to the internet for information to guide him. Tim discovers that each university has its own website brimming with information, giving him a glimpse of what to expect. But he also wants to compare these universities, and what could be more useful than **university rankings**!

These rankings are now, in most cases, data-driven, a trend that can be traced back to 1983 when a declining newspaper called [U.S. News and World Report](https://www.usnews.com) embarked on an ambitious project. This is also considered the first moment when these rankings significantly influenced students' university choices.

Do you think Tim, when using the ranking, knew how it was constructed? Why one university was ranked above another? And... does anyone know? Does anyone have any insight into how these rankings are made?

Well, as you can imagine, the journalists at this newspaper wanted to quantify educational excellence, but there's no direct way to quantify how this four-year process affects a student. You can't measure learning, happiness, friendships, etc.

These models end up relying on indicators, most of which are completely hidden from us.

Here are some plausible indicators:

<div class="center flex flex-grow justify-center">
  <div>
    <ul>
      <li>High school grades</li>
      <li>Student-to-faculty ratios</li>
      <li>University acceptance rate</li>
    </ul>
  </div>
  <div>
    <ul>
      <li>Percentage of alumni who contribute financially</li>
      <li>Tuition fees</li>
      <li>Research publications</li>
    </ul>
  </div>
</div>

As one might imagine, these indicators are very easy to manipulate. A university could, for example, inflate the grades of new students or falsify the percentage of recent graduates with jobs.

The U.S. News ranking was finally published in 1988 in the United States and it was a hit, it gained a tremendous amount of influence. However, it ended up being nothing more than a viscious feedback loop.

Now imagine a university performing poorly in the ranking; it loses reputation, and conditions worsen. The best students avoid it, as do the best professors. What will happen next year? Well, this university will fall even further.

But let's consider the opposite case, the case of Texas Christian University. During the initial years, its position dropped by more than 15 units, causing panic among the management team. Despite insisting that the university was improving in all aspects, other universities were progressing faster.

<a href="https://www.usnews.com/best-colleges/rankings/national-universities">

They decided to raise $250 million. A figure they surpassed. With these funds, they made the university a more attractive place for students, conveniently boosting their ranking. This resulted in a leap of 37 places. All of this is very nice, but who ends up paying the price? In the case of the United States, it's Tim and his peers with extremely high tuition fees.

But it's not all bad news for Americans. In 2014, under the Obama administration, the Department of Education released a wealth of data on a [website](https://collegescorecard.ed.gov), allowing students to ask their own questions. This resulted in a tool completely transparent for students, the opposite of rankings.

A couple of years pass, and now, at 25, Tim finds himself at a crossroads. He's finished his studies, spent some time in the workforce, but has an itch for change, so he ventures abroad in search of social and professional opportunities. After a few months, the desire to **find love** strikes him, and considering himself quite experienced in matters of the heart, he decides to dive into Tinder to give his love life a boost. Besides, his coworker had success with it, so why not him?

The search begins, and after days of swiping, he gets his first match that genuinely piques his interest. Tim, the hopeless romantic, becomes excited about his perfect match who lives just two kilometers away, he texts and they decide to meet. Things flow for a few months, but unfortunately, in a conversation, they share their views on relationships, and the person admits to only seeking fun and confesses that long-term relationships never work out for them. Heartbroken, but resolute, Tim decides to cut ties cleanly. This scenario repeats three more times over the next two years.

After all this time, Tim is left exhausted and convinced that love isn't for him. But one night, as he tosses and turns, he has an epiphany: what if Tinder has been showing him the same type of person repeatedly to keep him on this cycle? What do you think? Does Tinder have any impact on the people Tim has met in the last two years?

Now consider you are a dating app developer in the early stages of implementation. Try, with your best intentions, to elaborate a list of characteristics to be taken into account for setting up to potential partners. Here are a few suggestions:

<div class="center flex justify-center">
  <div>
    <ul>
      <li>Common interests</li>
      <li>Mutual friends</li>
      <li>Similar backgrounds</li>
    </ul>
  </div>
  <div>
    <ul>
      <li>Similar lifestyles</li>
      <li>Aesthetic preferences</li>
      <li>References</li>
    </ul>
  </div>
  <div>
    <ul>
      <li>Physical attraction</li>
      <li>Future outlook</li>
      <li>Aspirations</li>
    </ul>
  </div>
</div>

Getting back to Tim, after his epiphany, he opens his computer. In just two minutes of searching, he finds Tinder's algorithm patent. There, it explains that among other things, when you upload your image, the algorithm rates how attractive you are in relation to profiles with the most popularity. Therefore, as soon as you join, three things happen:

You will be assigned an attractiveness score
Your recommendations will be based on your attractiveness
You will perpetuate bias to the next users with your interactions

Notice the is the cycle of recommendation bias, on Tinder, each swipe conditions the next profile the app shows you. Therefore, the more you use it, the more biased it becomes towards a certain profile of people of whom you have no information. Plus, the recommendation comes without any explanation so Tim didn’t know the exact reasons of those recommendations (if there where any) to decide whether to go on those dates. So who does Tinder pair us with? Physical appearance matters a lot, as evidenced by their patent “empirical data shows that people match with others of similar attractiveness” ([Tinder Patent](https://patentimages.storage.googleapis.com/48/ae/4a/96fdf84751aebf/US9733811.pdf)) . But this measure of attraction is nothing more than a measure of popularity achieved through collaborative filtering, a recommendation technique based on recommending profiles that have been liked by similar people.

To finish, think from the perspective of being one of the creators of Tinder, what would you achieve if you paired everyone? Somehow, you would have to ensure a certain obsolescence in relationships. On this subject, there is an [article](https://www.cmu.edu/tepper/news/stories/2023/november/popularity-bias-dating-apps.html) from Carnegie Mellon University that goes a step further and concludes that online dating apps are more focused on perpetuating user engagement than finding successful matches.

After his recent heartbreak, Tim found himself embroiled in yet another complicated situation. As he ventured into new professional horizons, he encountered similar obstacles. Despite submitting several **job applications**, Tim was denied an interview for a promising position. The reason? The company's application screening algorithm automatically rejected candidates who lacked a specific language certificate—a certificate Tim did not possess. Once again, Tim faced an algorithmic bias that limited his job opportunities.

This new experience left Tim concerned about how algorithms function in selection processes and the lack of explainability in their decisions. It also highlighted the urgent need for greater transparency and oversight in the use of these technologies to prevent injustices and algorithmic biases in everyday life.

Facing persistent health problems, Tim decided to seek medical treatment to improve his situation. After exploring various options, he chose a treatment recommended by a specialist using artificial intelligence, which seemed promising.

Unfortunately, the treatment did not yield the expected results, and Tim's health continued to deteriorate. Puzzled, he began to investigate and discovered that the decision-making algorithm that guided the treatment recommendation was based on images with a specific measurement reference. This reference was necessary for the algorithm to yield a positive result. Sadly, the doctors who prescribed the treatment were unaware of this detail since the lack of explainability of the algorithm prevented Tim from receiving necessary information about the treatment and its limitations. Furthermore, the bias in the data used by the algorithm, which only contained images with the reference, contributed to this diagnostic error.

This experience left Tim with even more doubts and concerns about the reliability of algorithm-based technologies and their impact on his daily life. Unfortunately, his problems did not end there.
