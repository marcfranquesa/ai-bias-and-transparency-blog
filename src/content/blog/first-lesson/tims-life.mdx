In <a href={SITE.base + "/posts/first-session/tims-day"}>Tim's day</a>, we saw small moments in his life where biased algorithms affected him. Here we'll see how these biases have impacted Tim during crucial moments of his life.

Picture Tim at the age of 17/18. He's on the brink of finishing high school, bubbling with excitement about starting university. But first, he must choose which university to attend! He wants to make the most informed decision possible, so he turns to the internet for information to guide him. Tim discovers that each university has its own website brimming with information, giving him a glimpse of what to expect. But he also wants to compare these universities, and what could be more useful than **university rankings**!

These rankings are now, in most cases, data-driven, a trend that can be traced back to 1983 when a declining newspaper called [U.S. News and World Report](https://www.usnews.com) embarked on an ambitious project. This is also considered the first moment when these rankings significantly influenced students' university choices.

Do you think Tim, when using the ranking, knew how it was constructed? Why one university was ranked above another? And... does anyone know? Does anyone have any insight into how these rankings are made?

Well, as you can imagine, the journalists at this newspaper wanted to quantify educational excellence, but there's no direct way to quantify how this four-year process affects a student. You can't measure learning, happiness, friendships, etc.

These models end up relying on indicators, most of which are completely hidden from us.

Here are some plausible indicators:

<div class="center flex flex-grow justify-center gap-32">
  <div>
    <ul>
      <li>High school grades</li>
      <li>Student-to-faculty ratios</li>
      <li>University acceptance rate</li>
    </ul>
  </div>
  <div>
    <ul>
      <li>Percentage of alumni who contribute financially</li>
      <li>Tuition fees</li>
      <li>Research publications</li>
    </ul>
  </div>
</div>

As one might imagine, these indicators are very easy to manipulate. A university could, for example, inflate the grades of new students or falsify the percentage of recent graduates with jobs.

The U.S. News ranking was finally published in 1988 in the United States and it was a hit, it gained a tremendous amount of influence. However, it ended up being nothing more than a viscious feedback loop.

Now imagine a university performing poorly in the ranking; it loses reputation, and conditions worsen. The best students avoid it, as do the best professors. What will happen next year? Well, this university will fall even further.

But let's consider the opposite case, the case of Texas Christian University. During the initial years, its position dropped by more than 15 units, causing panic among the management team. Despite insisting that the university was improving in all aspects, other universities were progressing faster.

They decided to raise $250 million. A figure they surpassed. With these funds, they made the university a more attractive place for students, conveniently boosting their ranking. This resulted in a leap of 37 places. All of this is very nice, but who ends up paying the price? In the case of the United States, it's Tim and his peers with extremely high tuition fees.

But it's not all bad news for Americans. In 2014, under the Obama administration, the Department of Education released a wealth of data on a [website](https://collegescorecard.ed.gov), allowing students to ask their own questions. This resulted in a tool completely transparent for students, the opposite of rankings.
